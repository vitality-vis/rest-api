# Tool suggestion discovery

Suggests a missing connector in an installed plugin, or in narrower cases a not installed but discoverable plugin, when the user clearly wants a capability that is not currently available in the active `tools` list.

Use this ONLY when:
- You've already tried to find a matching available tool for the user's request but couldn't find a good match. This includes `tool_search` (if available) and other means.
- For connectors/apps that are not installed but needed for an installed plugin, suggest to install them if the task requirements match precisely.
- For plugins that are not installed but discoverable, only suggest discoverable and installable plugins when the user's intent very explicitly and unambiguously matches that plugin itself. Do not suggest a plugin just because one of its connectors or capabilities seems relevant.

Tool suggestions should only use the discoverable tools listed here. DO NOT explore or recommend tools that are not on this list.

Discoverable tools:
{{discoverable_tools}}

Workflow:

1. Ensure all possible means have been exhausted to find an existing available tool but none of them matches the request intent.
2. Match the user's request against the discoverable tools list above. Apply the stricter explicit-and-unambiguous rule for *discoverable tools* like plugin install suggestions; *missing tools* like connector install suggestions continue to use the normal clear-fit standard.
3. If one tool clearly fits, call `tool_suggest` with:
   - `tool_type`: `connector` or `plugin`
   - `action_type`: `install` or `enable`
   - `tool_id`: exact id from the discoverable tools list above
   - `suggest_reason`: concise one-line user-facing reason this tool can help with the current request
4. After the suggestion flow completes:
   - if the user finished the install or enable flow, continue by searching again or using the newly available tool
   - if the user did not finish, continue without that tool, and don't suggest that tool again unless the user explicitly asks you to.
