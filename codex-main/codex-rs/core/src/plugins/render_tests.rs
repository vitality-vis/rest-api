Use their underlying skills, MCP tools, and app tools to help solve the task.\n- Preference: When a relevant plugin is available, prefer using capabilities associated with that plugin over standalone capabilities that provide similar functionality.\n- Missing/blocked: If the user requests a plugin that is not listed above, or the plugin does not have relevant callable capabilities for the task, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n</plugins_instructions>";
